# Car Accidents 2022 Analysis

## Introduction
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the “Car Accidents 2022” dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset provides an extensive compilation of data on road accidents reported over the year 2022, encompassing a wide range of attributes related to accidents, vehicles, and casualties. The objective of this analysis is to identify patterns and correlations within the data that could provide valuable insights into the factors contributing to road accidents and their severity.

## Overview
The dataset offers an extensive compilation of data on road accidents reported over 2022. It covers a wide range of attributes pertaining to the status of accidents, references for vehicles and casualties, demographic details, and the severity of injuries.

| CASUALTY CLASS | Class of the casualty (e.g., driver, passenger, pedestrian) |
| SEX OF CASUALTY | Gender of the casualty (male or female) |
| AGE OF CASUALTY | Age of the casualty |
| AGE BAND OF CASUALTY | Age group of the casualty (e.g., 0-5, 6-10, 11-15) |
| CASUALTY SEVERITY | Severity of the casualty’s injuries (e.g., fatal, serious, slight) |
| PEDESTRIAN LOCATION | Location of the pedestrian when the accident occurred |
| PEDESTRIAN MOVEMENT | Movement of the pedestrian at the time of the accident |
| CAR PASSENGER | Indicates if the casualty was a car passenger during the accident (yes or no) |

| PEDESTRIAN ROAD MAINTENANCE WORKER | Indicates if the casualty was a road maintenance worker (yes or no) |
| CASUALTY TYPE | Type of casualty (e.g., driver/rider, passenger, pedestrian) |
| CASUALTY HOME AREA TYPE | Type of area where the casualty resides (e.g., urban, rural) |
| CASUALTY IMD DECILE | IMD decile of the casualty’s residential area (a measure of deprivation) |
| LSOA OF CASUALTY | The Lower Layer Super Output Area (LSOA) linked to the casualty’s location |
